TO DO
1) Save and load state
2) Implement breathing and remove legal terrain type
3) Much more thorough genetics of nervous system, including
    - breaking network into subcomponents
    - innate specification of all weights, but especially specific output action biases
    - differential learning weights for different layers
    - multiple (or no) hidden layers
4) Analysis of learning:
    - Some kind of evaluation of learning that can see if, after learning, does a relationship emerge between hunger and
    eating, or between being in grass and eating, or an interaction of the three. More distantly, is there a higher
    likelihood of moving to grass when hungry, or when grass is visible. Can this be traced to amount of reinforcement.
    - Does procreation desire change over time, and can it be traced to amount of reinforcement.
    - Can we evaluate whether Zebras like being around other Zebras, as a function of amount they are attacked or
    amount that they procreate
    - Are there any interesting sex differences


IDEAS
- the genotype as a distributed representation with hidden units. if you have genes consisting of "inputs", "outputs",
    and "hiddens", and different genes can evolve to share some of the same hiddens, then you end up with a mechanism
    by which different genes can start independent and become correlated.

- if you have neural units that a specifically coding for grounded versions of abstract things (like number or
    quantity of red pixels), hidden units connected to those neurons will end up encoding that property, but will then
    be use-able by other neurons to code for that property in a more abstract way

- make movement cost variable based on terrain type to simulate certain forms of locomotion being easy/hard for some
    animals. swimming easy for sea lion hard for lion, walking on land the opposite
- make resting cost variable based on terrain type, to simulate how staying on top of water might be more
    costly for some animals. thus resting could even incur a negative energy cost for some animals on some terrain
- these two combined should make being on land vs. being on water differentially pleasant once the animal
    gets reinforcement for resting benefit/cost as a function of terrain
- and of course animal can "drown" if it get's stuck in the water (ie if energy goes to zero while still in water)

- humorous story idea: the garden of eden was the simple version of teh world where 'God' tested his program to get all
    the parameters working right. once done, he kicked them out into the real world. And then humans had to invent a
    version of the story that made it all about them and their actions being the cause for the expulsion. Because that's
    how we roll.

- get rid of the legal action array as a constraint on what action can be chosen, and only make it effect whether the
    action is carried out. so you can still choose to eat in a desert, but with no concurrent energy gain. side effects
    would need to be dealt with, but point is it should lead to faster learning about what actions are legal in a
    given context.

- possibly worth adding a "frustration" drive, that reinforces action desires that are fulfilled by a successfully
    completed action, and that are punished for failing to take a desired action
        - this could work with the removing constraint on "illegal" actions.

- there is an inconsistency with health, energy, and arousal as the same kind of thing. Arousal is more of a trait that
ought to be genetically modifiable. Health definitely not. Energy has properties of both, and should probably be split up
into hunger and energy. Therefore energy and health are physical properties of the organism that flow from other things
and arent phenotypic traits, whereas hunger and arousal (or at least the propensity to feel those things) are phenotypic
traits that can be genetically modified.
